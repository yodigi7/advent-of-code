# Day 3
## Part 1
Each corner on each new ring is a square of an odd number

```

```

Calculate the width of the grid and then calculate the x and y coordinates of the input value
It will be on the outer ring, then need to calculate distance

Could normal brute force but feel like doing it a different and fun way

## Part 2
Just went back and built the grid as normal
Assumes we will find it before getting the the edge
